## Who are we?
* We are a community of like-minded developers who are committed towards promotion and adaptation of **open source software**. Open source is made by people just like you. Learn how to contribute, launch a new project, and build a healthy community of contributors with us.:heartpulse: ü§ù
* In February 1998, the open-source movement was adopted, formalized, and spearheaded by the [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative) (OSI), an organization formed to market software "as something more amenable to commercial business use" The OSI owns the trademark ["Open Source"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source). The main tool they adopted for this was [The Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition). We as an organisation abide by standards set by the OSI.

## Why Open Source?
* The collaborative nature of the open-source community creates software that can offer customizability and, as a result, promotes the adoption of its products.
* The open-source community promotes the creation of software that is not proprietary, resulting in lower costs.
* Individuals who have intrinsic interest in code writing and software creation motivate the development of open-source software within the community. This differs from proprietary software, the development of which is often motivated through potential monetary gains.‚úåÔ∏è
* Open source provides flexibility not available in closed products. The hope is that individuals make improvements to an open tool and will offer those improvements to the original developer and community at large. The give-and-take of the gift economy benefits the entire community.
* Open-source licenses and software can be combined with proprietary software. While open source was initially seen as a threat to corporations, some companies found ways to strengthen their proprietary code with open-source code, re-releasing it as an improvement.
* Globalization of Market.

## Our Mission üí™

* **AWARE :**
&ensp; **_We aim at spreading awareness about the advantages of using an open source software over conventional proprietary software._**
* **ADOPT :**
&ensp;**_Spreading awareness is futile until and unless we motivate people to adopt the prevailing open source softwares in their work environment._**
* **CONTRIBUTE :**
&ensp;**_The whole concept of Open source revolves around the community which uses it and contributing to the community is always a matter of prestige._**

<!--- ## Collaborators
Apart from the OPEN community as a whole, we have been offered support from the following esteemed organisations:
* The Linux Foundation
* Xebia--->
## Our Work 
We proudly present to you the projects that the Open community has been working on:
* What is open source? Where to start or how to contribute? What is Markdown? If these questions are in your mind then visit [**THE OPEN SOURCE GUIDE**](https://github.com/upes-open/TheOpenSourceGuide) especially curated to cater for your inquisitiveness about the world of open source.
* With great devotion and wholeheartedly we have assembled our official website [**THE OPEN WEB**](https://github.com/upes-open/open-web) for you.
* Want to keep an eye üëÄ on our events,news,social media,initiatives and more? Check out our [**OPEN MOBILE APPLICATION**](https://github.com/upes-open/Open-Mobile).
* An Application used to manage and maintain placement related data, activities, updates and more. Check out the [**PLACEMENT MANAGER**](https://github.com/upes-open/Placement-Manager).
* [**OPEN CERTIFICATION**](https://github.com/upes-open/Open-Certification) system enables administration to generate event certificates for participation and recommendations.
* An application that enables you to get access to medical facilities in college at any point in time. It will show you the list of available doctors üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è in real-time and you can register yourself for the appointment. Sounds incredible right? Check out [**AUTO INFORMARY**](https://github.com/upes-open/Auto-Infirmary) for more information.
* [**OPEN REGISTRATION**](https://github.com/upes-open/Open-Registrations-System) is a semi-automated registration system for external members at OPEN. It uses ReactJS and Firebase. It contains a dashboard which requires valid user login and e-mail verification. The portal asks for user's general information and social media links along with their University name.
